# ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Implemented a brute force algorithm `O(nÂ²)` to solve the Two Sum problem by iterating over all index pairs in an integer array.
- Utilized C++ STL containers `std::vector` to manage dynamic input/output efficiently.
- Applied reference passing `vector<int>&` to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary data copies.
- Designed early exit logic to improve execution flow by returning results immediately once the target condition was met.
- Strengthened understanding of control structures (nested loops, conditionals) and dynamic array operations (`push_back`, indexing).

# ðŸŽ¯ Problem Description
- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- You can return the answer in any order.
